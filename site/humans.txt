THEY HELP YOU

TheyHelpYou is a project to help vulnerable, shielding and self-isolating people
to find their local Community Hub and get help.

It is the inspiration, design and code of @boffbowsh, @Rossehkins and @RTO.

With lots of help crowd-sourcing the data from @CreaFarrar, @Doccykins, and many
others.

If you would like to help you, the most important thing you can do is:

  STAY HOME.
  PROTECT THE NHS.
  SAVE LIVES.

If you have time to spare you can contribute by reviewing and commenting where
you find out of date information in this spreadsheet:

For example, perhaps the Community Hub page has been updated and the URL has
changed.

Thank you, thank the Community Hub staff and volunteers, and #thankyouNHS
